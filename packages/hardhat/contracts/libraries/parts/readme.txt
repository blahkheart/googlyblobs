Please review all of these details. This new affiliate management system for Unlock NFTs would grow in time with more features, but it needs to start with just the core MVP functions.

The current Unlock system has a single tier level affiliate URL wallet tracking function, that pays out a referring affiliate instantly at the time of sale, at a set percentage % for that sale on just that one tier level, in the denominated cryptocurrency for that specific Unlock NFT.

This new Unlock NFT Affiliate Dapp UI System (UNADUS) will have several of those same features, but will also need to perform differently and with extra functionality.

Can have any Unlock NFT connected (or a group of NFTs) to this new affiliate management system
There can be an optional requirement for any new affiliate seeking to register to be required to hold a specific NFT (or multiple) or one NFT out of a designated collection of NFTs, in order to be able to register as a new affiliate
When the new affiliate successfully registers only once into a specific NFT, that NFT can be part of a group of other NFTs, a collection, so that one registration once by the affiliate enables them to promote all the NFTs in that collection
As the admin of the affiliate system, I can set which domain or specific URL the affiliates would be sharing, with a unique affiliate referencing suffix at the end of the URL, you can see an example of this at CryptoisFire.ai where on that page are actually 7 separate Unlock NFTs, 
but they are all different levels of an overall membership system. New members who hold these NFTs are able to access different content when they log into the Wordpress site, which checks which NFT they hold, to reveal membership content only for their level.

But affiliates joining should only need to join once, so as to be able to refer anyone to that single URL (CryptoisFire.ai) and from that track any purchase, to anyone of those 7 Unlock NFTs
Commissions on any Unlock NFT sales can be optionally paid out instantly to the affiliates at a set % percentage, but in addition, can also/or have any or all or a portion of the % percentage amount page out to the affiliates wallet at later time, eg 31 days later
This amount to be paid should be optionally either = automatically paid to each registered affiliates wallet, or can optionally be set to be a manual payout to just that one affiliate, or set to be a bulk manual payout to all affiliates … or can even be set to paid out on a regular defined 
payout schedule like once very month paid in arrears monthly to all affiliates, so they all get used to being paid on the 15th of every month (for example)
A very simple registration process for the affiliate to register requires they use their web3 wallet, their email, their name, the name of the person referring them, their phone number, their Twitter…. This can be a nicely designed affiliate onboarding sales signup page where I can edit the 
heading text and description text to make it encouraging to new affiliates considering to join up
The system automatically generates the affiliates URL for them, but also has the ability for the affiliate to then edit their own unique referring URL
After registering the affiliate can login to their own affiliate dashboard and see a series of sales stats, including = how many clicks on their own URL, listing all specific affiliates who have joined under them (showing their specific email and wallet), including which affiliates joined at 
which tier (1st, 2nd, 3rd), listing all specific buyers have who have joined under them (showing their specific email, wallet and amount spent), including which buyers have purchased inside their tiered affiliate network of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, calculating total sales volume for that day, week, 
month and cumulative total… plus a history of amounts already paid out (previous months) with on-chain transaction data, and any current amount of commissions due this month (if it is a scheduled payment system)
An ability for all new affiliates database entries to be webhook connected to an email newsletter management system so that regular emails can be sent out to them as a group
Must have at least 3 tiered levels of affiliate structure, with the option to add potentially more at a later time, and where each affiliate tier has a different % percentage commission that can be paid out, eg. Level one pays out 30% commissions, level 2 pays out 10%, level 3 pays out 5%
The ability for each level to require the ownership of specific NFT in their wallet to qualify for that tiered commission, eg, needing to hold X Unlock NFT to be able to earn commissions on tier 2 or 3
The ability to check has the affiliate earned a sufficient amount of commissions for that month to qualify for commissions on that tier, eg, needing to earn $1000 in commissions to get their % on sales on tier 2, and $2000 in commissions to get their % on sales on tier 3
Example on how the 3 tiers work:
Affiliate Alice (a 1st tier affiliate due to discovering CFIRE on her own, and registering as an affiliate), has been accepted as an authorized affiliate and makes a sale to a customer - Bob (who is her referral). Upon successful onboarding and expiration of the 30 day refund period, Alice has earned a 30% 
commission that will be released in the following month’s pay period, paid to Alice’s crypto web3 wallet in BNB.
In month 2, Bob decides he wants to be an authorized affiliate so he registers, gets accepted, and makes a sale to a new customer - Malory (who is his referral). Upon successful onboarding and expiration of the 30 day refund period, Bob has earned a 30% commission, which gets paid to his web3 wallet in BNB.
Alice then upgraded to the Meteor level to make sure she can earn that extra 2nd tier 10% commission (following her initial referral) because she made no extra sales in this month 2. Both these commissions will both be released in the next month’s pay period (following the expiry of the 30 day guarantee).
In month 3, Malory decides he wants to be an authorized affiliate so he registers, gets accepted, and makes a sale to a new customer - Eve (who is his referral). Upon successful onboarding and expiration of the 30 day refund period, Malory has earned a 30% commission, Bob also upgrades to Meteor to make 
sure he can earn that 10% 2nd tier commission (from his initial referral), and Alice upgrades to Supernova to make sure she can earn a 5% 3rd tier commission (from her initial referral). All of 
those commissions will all be released in the following month’s pay period (following the expiry of the 30 day guarantee period).


 It has a lot of moving parts that would involve a frontend with a dashboard area, smart contracts, backend/API (if needed), and testing and(or) a database
 Assume you are a professional freelance open source blockchain developer. Your task is as follows: 
 1. Create a project specifications and requirements document based on the information about the Dapp provided, outline each functionality to be implemented on the MVP so you and the client are clear on what to expect the 
 completed project to look like.
 2. Create milestones using frontend, smart contracts, backend/API (if needed), and testing. Listing the
 functionalities to be implemented at each milestone
 3. Assuming your charge for building the project is 5000 X tokens, create a quote for the client whereby
 1000 X tokens (preferably its equivalent in percentage) are paid upfront to commit to building the project and 1000 X token equivalent in percentage is paid after each milestone is completed such that the last tranch of 
 1000 X tokens are paid after the last milestone is completed.
